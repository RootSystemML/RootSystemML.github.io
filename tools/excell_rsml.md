RSMLx is a Windows based Excel plug-in for viewing and quantifying Root System Markup Language (RSML) files. Once installed, RSML files can be read directly into Excel, with quantification and thumbnail image output performed automatically.

The RSMLx source code is contained within the RootNav .NET solution, where it makes use of the RootNav libraries for reading RSML files and producing thumbnail images. RSMLx can be compiled directly from within Visual Studio, or can be installed using the pre-compiled installer. If using the installer, first unzip the installation folder, and run setup.exe. You will be prompted to install the plug-in.
