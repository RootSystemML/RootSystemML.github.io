RootSystemML.github.io
====================

Website for RootSystemML file format

The html content of this website is generated automatically by github from *.md files. Currently 2 such files are in use:
  - `index.md`: The main page of the site
  - `format.md`: Should hold the RSML format description, and/or link to relative data and files

The other files are theme-provided or taken from some tutorials and examples of github website I lost track of. Only some minor edition have been made in `_layout/default.html`.
