RootSystemML is a file format to represent root architectural data. It is has been designed to alleviate two major bottlenecks: 

 - to enable portability of root architecture data between different software tools in an easy and interoperable manner allowing seamless collaborative work, 
 - to provide a standard format upon which to base central repositories which will soon arise following the expanding worldwide root phenotyping effort.

RSML allows to store 2D or 3D image metadata, plant and root properties and geometries, continuous functions along individual root paths and a suite of annotations at the image, plant or root scales, at one or several time points. The plant ontologies are used to describe botanical entities that are relevant at the scale of root system architecture. 

Software
--------
The RSML format has been implemented in the follwing software:

 - SmartRoot
 - RootNav
 - RhizoScan
 - Root System Analyser

[See the supporting software page for more details](software)

File format
-----------
RSML is based on the XML standard and a xml-schema-definition (xsd) can be used to validate the validity of an RSML file.
Also [the file format page](format) gives a detailed description the features and constraints of RSML.
